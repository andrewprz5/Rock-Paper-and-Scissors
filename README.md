# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors

This is a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors. Most of this program is relied on Javascript
since functions are needed to allow the user to a decision and use one of the three to
throw against the computer. The computer also has the ability to decide which of the three
to choose in order to counteract what the user threw down. The winner is determined after
a 5 total rounds, and if the user wishes, they can choose to enter another match with the
computer. There will be no CSS input as it is not required for this project, but later
on, at some point, there will be a user-based interaction. As of now, this can be played
in the Console on the website's Developer Tools.
