# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors

This is a game of Rock, Paper and Scissors. Most of this program is relied on Javascript
since functions are needed to allow the user to choose one of three options that will be used 
against the computer. The computer also has this ability in order to counteract the choice the user made. 
The winner is determined after a total of 5 rounds, and if the user wishes, they can choose to enter
another match with the computer. UI Design and Event Listeners are implemented in this project as well.
